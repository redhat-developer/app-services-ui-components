## How to structure a component

Let's analyze an existing component to understand how it's stuctured.

    src/Kafka/CreateKafkaInstance
    ├── components
    │  ├── CloudProviderTiles.tsx
    │  ├── CloudRegionsSelect.tsx
    │  ├── FormAlerts.tsx
    │  ├── index.ts
    │  ├── InstanceInfo.tsx
    │  └── ModalAlerts.tsx
    ├── CreateKafkaInstance.css
    ├── CreateKafkaInstance.test.tsx
    ├── CreateKafkaInstance.stories.tsx
    ├── CreateKafkaInstance.tsx
    ├── index.ts
    └── machines
    ├── index.ts
    └── types.ts

### index.ts

Contains the exports that should be made available to the consumers of the `@rhoas/app-services-ui-components`.

You should not export internal components (see [components](#components)). For this component the exported items are:

```typescript

export * from "./CreateKafkaInstance"; // the main feature
export * from "./machines/types"; // types useful to provide the data to the main feature

```

> ⚠️ *Heads up!*
>
> Don't do this. It will expose the internal components as a public API of the package and we don't want that.
>
> ```typescript
>
> export * from './components'; // don't do this!
>
> ````

### components

All internal components that are needed to build the overall feature should be placed in a `components` folder.
Don't place these components in another folder called as the component itself, keep the folder flat. This way we
get better navigation of the components on Storybook.

There should be a barrel `index.ts` file that exports all the components in this folder to make it easier to the top level
components to consume them. For example, the `CreateKafkaInstance` component imports these components like so:

```typescript

import {
  CloudProvidersTiles,
  CloudRegionSelect,
  FormAlerts,
  InstanceInfo,
  ModalAlerts,
} from "./components";

```

### machines

It contains [Xstate](https://xstate.js.org/) machines, which are state charts that describe how the main feature works.

### *.stories.tsx and *.tests.tsx

Storybook stories are named following the naming convention `[ComponentName].stories.tsx` and live next to the component's
source file.

Jest tests are named following the naming convention `[ComponentName].test.tsx` and live next to the component's
source file.

### *.css

If a component needs additional CSS, it should be placed in a file following the naming convention `[ComponentName].css`
and live next to the component's source file.
